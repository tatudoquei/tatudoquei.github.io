Brazil’s runoff presidential election on Sunday pits two larger-than-life figures representing opposite ends of the political spectrum: the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who ruled the country from 2003 to 2010. Lula outperformed Bolsonaro during the first round of voting, 48% to 43%, but fell short of the outright victory that some had predicted. The outcome of the runoff will have profound implications for Latin America’s biggest and most populous nation.
